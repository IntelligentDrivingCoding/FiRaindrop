# FiRaindrop
To fill the huge gaps in Single Image Deraining (SID) and promote related research on fisheye image processing, we propose a large-scale dataset named FiRaindrop for fisheye image deraining for the first time. FiRaindrop contains ~13.6K rain/rain-free fisheye image pairs and ~28K real rain images, covering more than 500 real-world scenes with different illumination and semantics. All these images are captured with two wide-angle lens cameras with resolutions of $1280 \times 720$.  The cameras are produced and used by an automobile manufacturer and their mode number is 51CAMZI03015.

As shown in the left part of Fig, two wide-angle lenses are fixed to the rear of a vehicle using a simple bracket mold, so that we can easily keep the extrinsic of the cameras unchanged and conveniently take photos of different scenes. When taking rain/rain-free image pairs of a scene, we first keep the vehicle stationary and take pictures with a clean camera lens to get clean images. Then, we lightly sprayed the camera lens with a sprinkling to get light rain images. Finally, we sprinkled more water onto the lens to obtain heavy rain images. Each camera can get two image pairs i.e. light-rain/rain-free image pair and heavy-rain/rain-free image pair. Besides, we also take more than $\sim$28K additional images on rainy days without the rain-free (ground truth) images for subjective deraining evaluation. Compared with the real raindrop images, our synthesized raindrop image pairs have similar rain noise representation and distribution with pixel-aligned.
